# C - Binary Trees
In C, binary trees are a way to organize data in a tree-like structure where each node can have at most two children nodes, often called the left child and the right child. These nodes can store some data, and the structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Each node in a binary tree can have a pointer to its left child, its right child, and possibly its parent node. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for tasks like organizing hierarchical data, implementing search algorithms, and more.
###
Here is a list of functions that can be implemented for binary trees.
## 0 - Create a binary tree node

## 1 - Insert a node as the left-child of another node

## 2 - Insert a node as the right-child of another node

## 3 - Delete an entire binary tree

## 4 - Check if a node is a leaf

## 5 - Check if a given node is a root

## 6 - Pre-order traversal

## 7 - In-order traversal

## 8 - Post-order traversal

## 9 - Measure the height of a binary tree

## 10 - Measure the depth of a node in a binary tree

## 11 - Measure the size of a binary tree

## 12 - Count the leaves in a binary tree

## 13 - Count the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

## 14 - Measure the balance factor of a binary tree

## 15 - Check if a binary tree is full

## 16 - Check if a binary tree is perfect

## 17 - Find the sibling of a node

## 18 - Find the uncle of a node
